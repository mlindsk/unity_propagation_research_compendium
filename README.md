#  Inconsistent Evidence Smoothing in Bayesian Networks and Unity Propagation in Junction Trees
This repository contains the scripts needed to generate the results from the paper `Inconsistent Evidence Smoothing in Bayesian Networks and Unity Propagation in Junction Trees`.

 - The data sets in `data/raw` were downloaded from
   * https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

 - The graphs in `triang/nets` were downloaded from
   * https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/

All benchmarks were conducted on a Linux server with $56$ cores, $512$ GB RAM. Only a single core was used however, to get more reliable benchmarks.
