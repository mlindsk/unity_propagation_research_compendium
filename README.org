This repository contains the scripts needed to generate the results from the paper *Unity Propagation in Bayesian Networks Handling Inconsistency via Unity Smoothing*.

 - The data sets in =data/raw= were downloaded from
   * https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

 - The graphs in =triang/nets= were downloaded from
   * https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/

To generate all the results

 - Run =make= in a terminal (it takes a long time and should be, preferably, performed on a server)
 - The final results can be found in the =img= folder

All benchmarks were conducted on a Linux server with 56 cores and 512 GB RAM. Only a single core was used however, to get more reliable benchmarks.
